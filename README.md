4Humanities WhatEvery1Says Project Task Recipes

This repository contains resources and scripts for use by developers working on the 4Humanities WhatEvery1Says project.  The main file here is an iPython Notebook.  Download the .ipynb file to your local computer, open iPython Notebook, and import the .ipynb file too use live.

---------

Instructions for openiing iPython Notebook and importing a .ipynb file:

For example: If you have the Enthought Canopy distribution of Python, then you can open the iPython Notebook as follows:

1. Open Canopy (but not the Editor)
2. Under Tools in the task bar: click on "Canopy Command Prompt"
3. Then type "ipython notebook."  This will open the iPython notebook environment in a Web browser window (served from a local server launched in the background by Python)
4. Then follow this prompt to import the notebook: "To import a notebook, drag the file onto the listing below or click here." (import the .ipynb file downloaded from my Github)  (Note: I will be changing that file rapidly for the time being)
